# TCR-TerrariaChatRelay
Self-serving Terraria Chat Relay with extensible chat service support  

# To-do:

* Figure out why this only works on Windows and not Linux (or is it just my Linux server and/or my firewall?)
* Connect some more events
* Have Clients register their own commands for setting themselves up (examples: tokens, channel id's, etc.)

Other chat services considered: IRC, Slack

If you want to suggest a chat service, prioritize another, or contribute some code, please feel free to say so!
